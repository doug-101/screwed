# Usage

Enter a number into the search box to list drills and threads with close to
that diameter.  The number can be followed by a unit ("in" or a double quote
for inches, "mm" for millimeters).  If no unit is entered, it defaults to
inches (unless the "Metric Only" box is checked).  Fractional diameters can
also be entered.

Search entries can also be more specific.  Enter "#6" to find a numbered drill
or thread size.  Or "B" to find a lettered drill size.  Or enter ".25-20" or
"4x0.7" to show a particular thread size.

The blue names in the thread list can be clicked for more details for that
thread size.  Note that all of the thread dimensions given are nominals.

The "Include Uncommon Sizes" box can be checked to show less common drill and
thread sizes.
